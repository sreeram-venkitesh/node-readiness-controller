# Node Readiness Controller

<img style="float: right; margin: auto;"  width="180px" src="docs/logo/node-readiness-controller-logo.svg"/>

A Kubernetes controller that provides fine-grained, declarative readiness for nodes. It ensures nodes only accept workloads when all required components eg: network agents, GPU drivers,
storage drivers or custom health-checks, are fully ready on the node.

This project implements the proposed [NodeReadinessGates](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/5416) API (KEP 5416) as an out-of-band solution and brings it to any Kubernetes cluster.

Use it to orchestrate complex bootstrap steps in your node-init workflow, enforce node health and improve workload reliability.

## What is Node Readiness Controller?

The Node Readiness Controller extends Kubernetes' node readiness model by allowing you to define additional pre-requisites for nodes (as readiness rules) in node conditions. It automatically manages node taints to prevent scheduling until all specified conditions are satisfied.

## Why This Project?

Kubernetes node has a simple "Ready" condition. Modern workloads need more crtical infrastructure dependencies before they can run.

With this controller you can:
- Define custom readiness for your workload
- Automatically taint and untaint nodes
- Support continuous readiness enforcement to block scheduling for fuse break scenarios
- Integrate with existing problem-detectors like NPD or any custom daemons / node plugins for reporting readiness

### Key Features

- **Multi-condition Rules**: Define rules that require ALL specified conditions to be satisfied
- **Flexible Enforcement**: Support for bootstrap-only and continuous enforcement modes
- **Conflict Prevention**: Validation webhook prevents conflicting taint configurations
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview rule impact before applying changes
- **Comprehensive Status**: Detailed observability into rule evaluation and node readiness status
- **Node Targeting**: Use label selectors to target specific node types
- **Bootstrap Completion Tracking**: Prevents re-evaluation once bootstrap conditions are met

## Demo

**Example Rule**

```yaml
apiVersion: readiness.node.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeReadinessRule
metadata:
  name: network-readiness-rule
spec:
  conditions:
    - type: "example.com/CNIReady"
      requiredStatus: "True"
  taint:
    key: "readiness.k8s.io/NetworkReady"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
    value: "pending"
  enforcementMode: "bootstrap-only"
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
```
